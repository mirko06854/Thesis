note: the folders "{name_log}_out" contains both the conformance evaluation and the fitness and precision graphs of each log (both with fixed P and variable N, and with fixed N and variable P). For some of them there are also collages of petri nets and heuristic nets ( one image for each 10 trials: all merged ). These lasts are in the folder "name_log_out\visualizations_complete_avg_algorithm". I have not generated for all logs because otherwise the evaluation of conformance and generation of many images required too much time.
